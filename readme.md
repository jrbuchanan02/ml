# ML
Machine learning library born from (admittedly) frustration with impulsively
running new research into neural networks on my laptop. Instead of using python
and countless libraries to run a jupyter notebook using software really intended
to make a new paper from the work, or waiting for ten minutes at a time for a 
free online tool to run the network and have it crash (with Python's admittedly
unfortunate scope rules). ML hopes to allow a machine learning software to run
simply and effectively.

Or, since I'm making this without the latest knowledge on how neural networks
work, an interesting project that cannot compete with the most powerful systems.

Either way, it's going to be a Machine Learning system written entirely in cuda
and C++.
